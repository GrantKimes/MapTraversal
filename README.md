# MapTraversal
Project for class: Algorithms in C++. 

This was the final project for a C++ programming course at the University of Miami. I revisited it months later to continue working and improving it. It combines many concepts I have learned through my classes in software engineering, as well as some other topics I have learned about on my own:

- Designing and organizing a large  code base from scratch. 
- Managing large database files and reading into corresponding data structures (hash table and vectors).
- Graph traversal techniques to find the shortest path.
- Graphics library usage to draw images. 
- Various techniques for well-structured code: header files, using debugger, inheritance


Pictures of the working program are available in the screenshots folder.
